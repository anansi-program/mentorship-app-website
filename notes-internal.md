What is the purpose of the mentorship program?
The purpose of Ananse's Mentorship Program is to expose undergraduate students to a variety of opportunities in their respective fields of study, and to provide guidance and support as they navigate their academic and professional journeys. By matching students with mentors, thriving in their respective careers, the program helps to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world application, and prepares students for success in their chosen fields. Ultimately, the program aims to empower students to achieve their goals and make a positive impact in their communities and the world.


Who is eligible to participate in the program?
At the moment, the mentorship program is open to mentees who are undergraduate students in either the Computer or Biomedical Engineering program at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology located in Ghana. However as our organization grows, we plan to expand to other universities in Ghana and other countries in Africa. Stay tuned for more updates on our expansion plans!
